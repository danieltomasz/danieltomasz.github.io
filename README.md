# My Personal site
## Daniel Borek - an academic and data scientist

In my projects, I'm constantly switching between Python and R.

I came to Belgium to work at Ghent University in a project about spectral parametrization of neural oscillations. This research draws on my computational background to shed light on the brain's rhythmic (and non-rhythmic) activity.

Currently, I am based in Brussels, Belgium.
