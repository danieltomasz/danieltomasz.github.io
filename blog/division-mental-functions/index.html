<p>This is a recurring discussion going on in Cognitive Science, this time on Twitter. Luiz Pessoa asked about why we divide cognitive functions like attention, memory, executive control the way we did. He tracks it to the beginning of psychology as discipline and influence of  William James and later, when the cognitive revolution started, to  Ulric Neisser’s Cognitive Psychology book. There is a really interesting discussion below this tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) In neuroscience, we study things like 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗺𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗿𝘆, 𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗲𝘅𝗲𝗰𝘂𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹, etc. <br>Buy why do we carve mental function this was?<br>Any good references that discuss this issue?<br>Please share with possible</p>&mdash; Luiz Pessoa (@PessoaBrain) <a href="https://twitter.com/PessoaBrain/status/1364264706505121797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>This echoes discussion between two camps, which most famous proponents are currently György Buzsáki and David Poeppel. Here is a discussion between them in one of &ldquo;Brain inspired&rdquo;  <a href="https://braininspired.co/podcast/84/">episodes</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I state something trivial, but I think all these terms used in Cognitive Science are a little bit blurry.
It allows scientists to escape any clear borders between processes defined by these terms. On the other hand, scientists in a theory are well aware that there is no process in isolation (but this sometimes is much harder to operationalize in practice).</p>
<p>Many different philosophers and neuroscientists told much about this topic. Currently, neuroinformatics could provide some nice tools. Read more this <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033729">review by Russell A. Poldrack and Tal Yarkoni</a>.</p>
