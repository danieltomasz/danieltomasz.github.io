Hi there! 👋 I'm Daniel, a productivity nerd, open science and linux enthusiast and a PhD candidate working to learn more about the nature of neural oscillations.

## 👨‍💻 My Work

I graduated Bachelor and Master studies at the University of Warsaw, obtaining the diploma in physics at College of Inter-Faculty Individual Studies in Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MISMaP). I worked in a one of the departaments of Polish Ministry of Health doing  statistics and data visualisation in R.

Currently I am based in Belgium, where I do my doctoral project analysing neural data at Ghent University.
