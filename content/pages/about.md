# Daniel Borek

Hi! My name Daniel Borek.

I live in Brussels, Belgium and I analyse data using R and Python.
### An academic

I studied physics within a MISMaP interdisciplinary programme and philosophy at University of Warsaw.

I came to Belgium to work at Ghent University in a project about spectral parametrization of neural oscillations.
I am applying my skills and knowledge of statistical inference, data analysing techniques, and data visualisation to problems of understanding human brain.

This research draws on my computational background to shed light on the brain's rhythmic (and non-rhythmic) activity.

I am interested in neurophysiology, computational cognitive science, metascience (research on research, especially reproducibility and open science) and philosophy of science.

### … and data scientist

In my projects, I'm constantly switching between Python and R.

Before starting PhD, I worked as a data analyst in the area of health policy, doing data analysis, data visualisation and report automation in R.

I did traineeship at the European Commission, DG Research and Innovation, where I contributed to monitoring of digital and data-sharing aspects of some EU-funded projects on health research.

I am passionate about health data and using data visualisation to provide new insights.

### Hobbies

I ❤️ cinema.
