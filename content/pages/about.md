## Daniel Borek

Hi! My name is Daniel Borek.

I live in Brussels, Belgium and I analyse data using R and Python.

### An academic

I studied physics within a MISMaP interdisciplinary programme and philosophy at University of Warsaw.

My doctoral projects at Ghent University focusing on  spectral parametrization of neural oscillations.

This research draws on my computational background to shed light on the brain's rhythmic (and non-rhythmic) activity.
I am applying my skills and knowledge of statistical inference, data analysing techniques, and data visualisation to problems of understanding human brain.

My general scientific interess are neurophysiology, computational cognitive science, metascience (research on research, especially reproducibility and open science) and philosophy of science.

### … and data scientist

In my projects, I'm constantly switching between Python and R.

Before starting PhD, I worked as a data analyst in the area of health policy, doing data analysis, data visualisation and report automation in R.

I did traineeship at the European Commission, DG Research and Innovation, where I contributed to monitoring of digital and data-sharing aspects of some EU-funded projects on health research.

I am passionate about health data and using data visualisation to provide new insights.

### Hobbies

I ❤️ cinema. 

I like listening to podcasts while I am cooking :smile: . 

During my free time I am learning Dutch and French.
