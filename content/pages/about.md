title: About
---

I studied physics within a MISMaP interdisciplinary programme and philosophy at University of Warsaw.

I came to Belgium to work at Ghent University in a project about spectral parametrization of neural oscillations. This research draws on my physics background to shed light on the brain's rhythmic (and non-rhythmic) activity.

Currently, I am based in Brussels, Belgium.

### An academic and data scientist

In my projects, I'm constantly switching between Python and R.

I am applying my skills and knowledge of statistical inference, data analysing techniques, and data visualisation to problems of understanding human brain.
I interested in neurophysiology, computational cognitive science, metascience (research on research, especially reproducibility and open science) and philosophy of science.

Before starting PhD, I worked as a data analyst in the area of health policy, doing data analysis, data visualisation and report automation in R.

I did traineeship at the European Commission, DG Research and Innovation, where I contributed to monitoring of digital and data-sharing aspects of some EU-funded projects on health research.

I am passionate about health data and using data visualisation to provide new insights.

### Hobbies

I ❤️ cinema.
