## Daniel Borek

I’m a PhD candidate at Ghent University learning more about the nature of neural oscillations.

I studied physics within a MISMaP interdisciplinary programme and philosophy at University of Warsaw.

#### An academic and data scientist

Before starting PhD, I worked as a data analyst in the area of health policy, doing data analysis, data visualisation and report automation in R.
I am passionate about health data and using data visualisation to provide new insights.

Currently, I am based in Brussels, Belgium.
I ❤️ cinema.
