This isn't a complete list, just a mention of several tools that are helping me.

## Hardware

Devices/setup I am using to work:

- MacBook Pro 13" M1 (2020) with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD
- Monitor: LG 34WN750 - QHD Ultrawide IPS - 34 Inches
- Mouse: Logitech MX Vertical Ergonomic
- Keyboard: Keychron K2 and Apple Magic Keyboard
- Apple iPad Pro 12 Inches (Late 2018)
- Chair: Ikea Markus

## Development

My current IDE for Python is **DataSpell**  by JetBrains. It is basically a PyCharm with some additional features for data analysis. For a long time I was using **VSCode**, but Pycharm is much easier to retain focus.

I am still using VSCode for Markdown editing, and compiling bigger projects to PDF or HTML with [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/). I am using VSCode for writing my blog posts and maintaing  this site generated by **Hugo** as well.

I use **zsh** as my shell (together with **oh-my-zsh** and **powerlevel10k** theme).

## Productivity

I am managing my scientific references with **Zotero**.

**Omnifocus** is my way to go for task and project management, but I also have a practive of writing a daily note in **Obsidian**. Most my other Markdown notes lives in Obsidian as well.

In addition to Apple/Google calendars, I am using **[Cron](https://cron.com/changelog)**, it has a nice Menu Bar widget that display the current/upcoming task from my Google calendar.

I like **Pomodoro** techinique, I am planning my day with the  **FocusMate** sessions of 50 minutes of work with stangers in mind. You can find my profile [here](https://www.focusmate.com/user/daniel-b20).

**Alfred** is my way to launch apps and workflows.

I am using **Magnet** as my window manager, but recently I am experimenting with **Amethyst**.

**KepassXC** is my password manager.

## Reading, learning, watching

For reading **RSS** I am using **Reeder** (both on Mac and iOS).

I am using [**DevonThink**](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink) for saving articles for later reading and managing my documents.

[**Mubi**](https://mubi.com/en/) for is my place for watching movies online. And I am recommending it to everyone who is interested in cinema.
