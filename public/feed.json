Forcing figures to be placed where they are in the text Allowing to use figures from different folders, and allowing to use relative paths to figures. Use Profiles to Compile either Whole Book or Thesis or Single Chapter Since quarto 1.2 profiles are introduced 1 In my use case I have on profile _quarto-thesis.yml which include all chapters and preambles, and another _quarto.yml which I can use just to compile the current markdown file; If I want to render whole thesis I just use quarto render --profile thesis; you could have as many as you want of those profiles (I was procrastinating that way with different look and templates for my thesis :slight_smile: )\nRoman Numbering for front Matter and Arabic for Main Matter I am inserting roman numbering for front matter and arabic for main matter.\nformat: pdf: include-before-body: text: | \\pagestyle{plain} \\pagenumbering{roman} In main tex I switch back to arabic numbering:\n\\pagenumbering{arabic} Problem with index.md and Inserted Blank Page As you write complex project, you want might want to have separate files for each chapter.\nWhen you are using quarto to render your project, you could put them inside index.md in your root folder:\n{{include \u0026#34;chapters/chapter1.qmd\u0026#34;}} {{include \u0026#34;chapters/chapter2.qmd\u0026#34;}} Using include filter will add the content of the files to the index.md file when compiling.\nThis is nice solution, but I have a problem when I want to use quarto preview to update and monitor resulting pdf when I change something in source files.\nUnfortunately, quarto preview does not update output .pdf file when files added with include change, so I needed to choose another solution.\nAlternative solution is to add chapters into you _quarto.yml file:\nproject: output-dir: _output execute-dir: file book: title: Title of my thesis or book author: name: Author Name chapters: - index.qmd - chapters/chapter1.md - chapters/chapter1.md I want to all of my content of to live in the \u0026lsquo;chapters\u0026rsquo; folder.\nUnfortunately currently in quatro users always need to include index.md (it makes sense when generating html as output, but not always when generating pdf).\nI can leave the index.md file empty, but then I will have an empty page between my table of content and first chapter.\nI can include the first chapter into index.md but then we were hitting the same problem on smaller scale again.\nMy Solution By default, latex is adding a page break after each chapter, and the index.md file is treated as a chapter, even if empty.\nAs a hack, I am hiding the problem by relaxing \\clearpage behaviour in latex.\nI am leaving my index.md file almost empty, I\u0026rsquo;m just adding this latex code 2:\n\\let\\standardclearpage\\clearpage \\let\\clearpage\\relax Then within my first chapter when my content start, I am returning to standard behaviour of \\clearpage:\n\\let\\clearpage\\standardclearpage This way I am not adding any extra page between my table of content and first chapter, and I can use quarto preview to monitor my changes.\nIn future the quatro behaviour might change regarding inclusion of `index.md``, you can follow discussion here:\nUseful Materials I just saw this post published on the blog of Cameron Patrick, it contains more useful information about writing thesis with quarto: https://cameronpatrick.com/post/2023/07/quarto-thesis-formatting/.\nI am personally using modified quarto-thesis template for my thesis, you can find it here: https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/quarto-thesis\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t use quarto, but you want to play with it, you can modify it online on the Posit virtual Rstudio instance https://rstudio.cloud/content/4383755 (free account required)\nReferences Quarto - Project Profiles\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://tex.stackexchange.com/a/176109\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n",

In this post I\u0026rsquo;ll share my experiences and how I\u0026rsquo;m now using Hugo and Quarto together for my blog.\nWhy I Switched back to Hugo I used Jekyll years ago (you can see one of the pages I created here), then switched to Hugo, and about a year ago I started using Quarto.\nQuarto is great for scientific publishing, but I found it too limiting for a personal blog:\nEvery post must be in its own folder with an index.qmd file. This works well for showcasing content, but isn\u0026rsquo;t convenient for writing. As a scientific publishing tool, the blog features remain an afterthought. The Quarto team is great about adding features, but blog improvements happen slowly. So I decided to switch back to Hugo as my static site generator for the flexibility.\nFortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to fully abandon Quarto. Quarto has built-in support for outputting to Hugo. I can use Quarto to render my posts written in qmd format into Markdown that Hugo can use.\nQuarto Loves Hugo Here is a quick overview of how I have Hugo and Quarto working together:\nI added some config settings to my Hugo config.toml file: ignoreFiles = [ \u0026#34;\\\\.qmd$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\\\\.ipynb$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\\\\.py$\u0026#34; ] [markup] defaultMarkdownHandler = \u0026#34;goldmark\u0026#34; [markup.goldmark.renderer] unsafe = true I have a content/posts folder containing subfolders for each post, with a index.qmd file inside.\nI put this _quarto.yml in the Hugo root directory:\nproject: type: hugo format: hugo-md: code-fold: true html-math-method: webtex execute: warning: false To create post written in qmd files, I run quarto render which outputs Markdown from my qmd posts into the Hugo content folder. I also found two nice blog posts from people using Quarto with Hugo:\n🪄 Quarto, Hugo, Apero | Cédric Batailler. Cédric is using lovely Apero theme. I am finding this theme great, but I choose to stick with minimalism of lines theme. Setting up a Hugo Website with Quarto | Paul Johnson. Paul is using a PaperMod theme, which is also very nice. He is a bit more technical in his post Paul Johnson describe how he render mermaid diagrams (supported in Quarto) in this blogpost. Customizing the Theme I started from the lines theme, you can find it here.\nLater I mixed it with another theme, simplist by the same author and I added my custom CSS parts.\nMore Customisation I started with the Lines theme, customised it with styles from the Simplist theme, and added some of my own CSS.\nHugo and GitHub Pages I followed Hugo\u0026rsquo;s GitHub Pages guide but ran into some issues:\nThe theme submodule wasn\u0026rsquo;t syncing properly. I had to manually add the .gitmodules file. The theme\u0026rsquo;s example content was cluttering my published site. I forked the theme and removed the examples. Here is my final .gitmodules file:\n[submodule \u0026#34;themes/lines\u0026#34;] path = \u0026#34;themes/lines\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/danieltomasz/lines.git\u0026#34; Hugo and Code Highlighting To get code highlighting in backticks markdown fences I enabled:\npygmentsStyle = \u0026#34;pygments\u0026#34; pygmentsCodefences = true Adding Comments with giscus I followed various blogpost with the configuration advices.\nBy default, giscus is adding comments to every page, but I wanted to have comments only on my posts.\nI followed advice1 and I wrapped my addition of giscus partial into footer.html with if statement:\n{{ if not .Params.noComment }} {{ partial \u0026#34;giscus\u0026#34; . }} {{ end }} When I don\u0026rsquo;t want to include a comments block, I am adding this in the frontmatter of the post (yaml):\nnoComment: true Some other useful links: https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/05/tips-using-giscus/\nDate of Last Edit Directly from Github Some advice how to set up it: Add a Last Edited Date to Posts · Make with Hugo.\nOne caveat: setting enableGitInfo to true in your site’s configuration file sometimes is not enough2.

      "summary": "",
      "content_text": "About Callouts Disclaimer: Previous version of this post was originally published as a public gist\nCallouts are a great way to highlight important details in your text by adding boxes with icons. Many flavours of markdown support them (but might use different syntax).\nQuarto supports 5 callout types:\nnote warning important tip caution. Each type has a different color and icon. You can see examples in the Quarto documentation.\nThe Problem To use callouts in Quarto markdown (qmd) files, you need to use Pandoc\u0026rsquo;s div syntax:\n::: {.callout-note} This is a note callout ::: But Obsidian doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognise this syntax. Instead, it uses:\n\u0026gt; [!note] My note \u0026gt; \u0026gt; Note content So there\u0026rsquo;s no easy way to preview nice callouts in Obsidian before compiling to PDF.\nGithub also introduced callouts into its markdown flavour with the same syntax under name of Alerts\nLua Filters to the Rescue Pandoc supports Lua filters that can modify the markdown before compilation.\nI found a filter on the Obsidian forum and modified it to support Quarto callouts. You need to save the filter as obsidian-callouts.lua in your project\u0026rsquo;s filters folder.\nThen point to it in _quarto.yml:\nfilters: - filters/obsidian-callouts.lua Content of the file obsidian-callouts.lua is in the following gist :\nThis makes Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s callout syntax compile properly in Quarto.\nTweaking Obsidian CSS By default Obsidian only styles note and warning callouts. To match Quarto, add this CSS:\n/* See https://lucide.dev for icon codes */ /* annotation */ .callout[data-callout=\u0026#34;important\u0026#34;] { --callout-color: 251, 70, 76; --callout-icon: lucide-alert-circle } .callout[data-callout=\u0026#34;tip\u0026#34;] { --callout-color: 28, 207, 110; --callout-icon: lucide-lightbulb } .callout[data-callout=\u0026#34;caution\u0026#34;] { --callout-color: 255,153,102; --callout-icon: lucide-flame } Now the callouts look (almost) the same in Obsidian and compiled PDFs!\nBelow is the Obsidian markdown that can be used to generate the basic 5 types of callouts that map nicely to Quarto types:\n\u0026gt; [!note] My note \u0026gt; \u0026gt; Note content \u0026gt; [!warning] My note \u0026gt; \u0026gt; Note content \u0026gt; [!important] My note \u0026gt; \u0026gt; Note content \u0026gt; [!tip] My note \u0026gt; \u0026gt; Note content \u0026gt; [!caution] My note \u0026gt; \u0026gt; Note content Obsidian support for callouts is much more extensive.\nCaveat This approach makes callouts render nicely in Obsidian, but may break other Quarto-supporting editors. Test thoroughly before relying on it.\nRemember that in order for callouts to work you need to leave an empty line starting with \u0026gt; between title and content. If you want a line break in the rendered callout, you might need the same trick.\nSince Quarto 1.3 callouts are represented as a custom AST node. (An earlier version of Lua filter that generated native Pandoc Divs)[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/rendering-callouts-similarly-in-pandoc/40020/6] will not work with latest Quarto.\nBonus: Wikilinks Obsidian also supports wikilinks, which are a great way to link between notes. They are not supported in Quarto, but you can use a Lua filter to convert them to regular text in the rendered file. Unfortunately, this version doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully support aliases in wikilinks. Also be careful, as this gist is not thouroughly tested, but works in all simple cases I tested it.\nAdd it to _quarto.yml or the yaml header of your document:\nfilters: - filters/wikilinks-filter.lua More Obsidian + Quarto Tips I use plugins to preview Quarto files in Obsidian:\nobsidian-shellcommands to run quarto render Custom button with commander to rerun compilation qmd-as-md-obsidian for basic qmd support See the plugin README for more workflow advice.\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n",

If you want a line break in the rendered callout, you might need the same trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Quarto 1.3 callouts are represented as a custom AST node. (An earlier version of Lua filter that generated native Pandoc Divs)[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/rendering-callouts-similarly-in-pandoc/40020/6] will not work with latest Quarto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"bonus-wikilinks\"\u003eBonus: Wikilinks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObsidian also supports wikilinks, which are a great way to link between notes. They are not supported in Quarto, but you can use a Lua filter to convert them to regular text in the rendered file. Unfortunately, this version doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully support aliases in wikilinks. Also be careful, as this gist is not thouroughly tested, but works in all simple cases I tested it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cscript src=\"https://gist.github.com/danieltomasz/bde887dcc775bd47acc0ddf993e3ec2b.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdd it to \u003ccode\u003e_quarto.yml\u003c/code\u003e or the yaml header of your document:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-yml\" data-lang=\"yml\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#000080\"\u003efilters\u003c/span\u003e:\u003cspan style=\"color:#bbb\"\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#bbb\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e- filters/wikilinks-filter.lua\u003cspan style=\"color:#bbb\"\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"more-obsidian--quarto-tips\"\u003eMore Obsidian + Quarto Tips\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use plugins to preview Quarto files in Obsidian:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eobsidian-shellcommands\u003c/code\u003e to run \u003ccode\u003equarto render\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCustom button with \u003ccode\u003ecommander\u003c/code\u003e to rerun compilation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ccode\u003eqmd-as-md-obsidian\u003c/code\u003e for basic \u003ccode\u003eqmd\u003c/code\u003e support\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/danieltomasz/qmd-as-md-obsidian\"\u003eplugin README\u003c/a\u003e for more workflow advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me know if you have any other questions!\u003c/p\u003e\n",
