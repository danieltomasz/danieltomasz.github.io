      <description>Zotero is a free, open-source reference management software. It make the process of collecting and storing references pretty easy (sometimes too easy !).&#xA;The latest stable, big release version, Zotero 6, was introduced in March 2022. It brought a new built-in PDF viewer and annotation system, as well as iOS and iPadOS apps.&#xA;Zotero 7 is Coming Recently, the devs shared a public beta of Zotero 7. Most of the updates are related to transitioning from the legacy Firefox 60 ESR, which Zotero was originally built on top of (Zotero started as a browser extension), to the newer Firefox 102 ESR now and Firefox 115 ESR before the release this year.</description>
